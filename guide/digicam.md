## Troubleshooting & Questions
### "Are the photos directly mailed to me?"
> No. We use the email address you have registered via Set Personal Data.
> Your photos are rendered on our server, and a ZIP file is emailed directly to you.

> If you want your Photos printed, you will have to do that yourself with a Printer.

### "The Photo Print Channel is telling me that my selected image is not supported!"

> Photo Print only supports "baseline" (not "progressive", or "interlaced") JPEGs. Here are some tips to make your photo compatible:
- Using Photoshop:

    - Go to File > Export > Save for Web (Legacy)

     - Change the format to JPEG. Make sure to uncheck 'Progressive' and 'Optimized'.

- Using Paint.NET:
    - Go to File -> Save As...

    - Change the 'Save as type' to JPEG, and save.

    - You do not need to change any options - Paint.NET does not support progressive JPEG, and will save as baseline.

### "Photo Print is telling me that my address is within 'Dallas, TX'"
> This is the default address. Please change it via the "Set Personal Data" App.

### "I use Dolphin. My photos or Miis sometimes become black. What can I do?"
> Within Dolphin's graphics settings, disable the setting "Store XFB Copies to Texture Only".

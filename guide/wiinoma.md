## Troubleshooting & Questions
### "I keep running into an error code starting with `354`! What can I do?"
> Please join our Discord server or message us on our Twitter account with more information. This error is server-side, so please let us know what happened for it to occur!

### "I have a PAL Region console, Wii Room freezes or crashes!"

> Unfortunately, this is a known issue. We're aware of many crashes for PAL region consoles. We continue to work on a solution for this, thank you for your patience. 

### "Why can I not rent Movies or TV Shows in Wii Room?"

> You can't purchase Movies & TV Shows yet because of the Theater not being implemented yet.

### "Can I suggest videos to be put on Wii Room?"

> Because so many people would like to suggest videos for Wii Room, we currently restrict this ability to our Patreon donators.

On MacOS, right click the `WiiLink_Patcher_macOS_v1.X.X` file in Finder and click Open. <br>

3. Press `1` to choose "`Start Express Install Setup`".
4. Follow the on screen instructions to select which versions of the available channels you would like.
5. At step 6, press `1` to begin patching.

7. Once it's done, you can safely close the patcher. All of the files are ready on your SD Card.

13. If your Wii is not a Japanese region, install `WiiLink_SPD(Wii).wad` or `WiiLink_SPD(vWii).wad`(Depending on console) before anything else. This is required so that we know your email address to send files.

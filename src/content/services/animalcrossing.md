<l class="notice warn smallwidth">Although this service is accessible via our DNS, it is externally managed by Larsen. Direct any queries to him with his contact information at https://larsenv.xyz.</l>

### Get special items delivered to you right on your Wii!

1. Go to the Wii Settings --> Internet --> Connection Settings --> the Connection that you're using --> Change Settings.

2. Make your way to the "Auto-Obtain DNS" setting.

<l class="notice info smallwidth">Take note that the "Auto-Obtain IP Address" and "Auto-Obtain DNS" settings both look similar, so be sure that you're on the DNS setting.</l>

3. Once you made sure that you're on the DNS setting, Click on "No", then "Advanced Settings".

Set your Primary DNS to --> 167.235.229.36<br>
Set your Secondary DNS to --> 1.1.1.1

4. After you're done setting up the DNS, save the changes and let the system perform the Connection Test.

<l class="notice generic smallwidth">If the Connection Test failed, use a different Internet Connection or try again.</l>

6. Go to the 1st page of the "Internet" category, then select "User Agreements", then select "Yes".

7. Allow the EULA to load. If it tells you that WiiConnect24 isn't being offered in your region, change your country to a supported one and try again (we recommend the United Kingdom for PAL, and the United States for NTSC-U). The developers recommended that you read the EULA, as it gives information about the service. If you do not see the WiiLink logo on the EULA, the DNS will not work on your network. If you want to enable it, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/RiiConnect24/DNS-Server">DNS Server application</a>.

8. Once you read the EULA, click on "I ACCEPT".

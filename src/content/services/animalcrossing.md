<l class="notice warn smallwidth">Although this service is accessible via our DNS, it is externally managed by Larsen. Direct any queries to him with his contact information at https://larsenv.xyz.</l>

### Get special items delivered to you right on your Wii!

1. Go to the Wii Settings --> Internet --> Connection Settings --> the Connection that you're using --> Change Settings.

2. Make your way to the "Auto-Obtain DNS" setting.

<l class="notice info smallwidth">The "Auto-Obtain IP Address" and "Auto-Obtain DNS" settings both look similar, so be sure that you're on the DNS setting.</l>

3. Once you've made sure that you're on the DNS setting, Click on "No", then "Advanced Settings".

Set your Primary DNS to --> 167.235.229.36<br>
Set your Secondary DNS to --> 1.1.1.1

4. After you're done setting up the DNS, save the changes and let the system perform the Connection Test.

<l class="notice generic smallwidth">If the Connection Test failed, use a different Internet Connection or try again.</l>

6. Go to the 1st page of the "Internet" category, then select "User Agreements", then select "Yes".

7. Allow the EULA to load.

<l class="notice info smallwidth">If it tells you that WiiConnect24 isn't being offered in your region, or you receive error 221001, change your country to a supported one and try again (we recommend the United Kingdom for PAL, and the United States for NTSC-U).
</br>
After agreeing to the EULA, you can use AnyGlobe Changer in the Homebrew Channel to switch back to your actual country.</l>

The developers recommended that you read the EULA, as it gives important information about the service.

<l class="notice warn smallwidth">If you do not see the WiiLink logo on the EULA, the DNS will not work on your network. If you want to enable it, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/WiiLink24/DNS-Server">DNS Server application</a>.</l>

8. Once you read the EULA, click on "I ACCEPT".

9. Navigate back to the main settings page, select WiiConnect24, and set "WiiConnect24" and "Standby Connection" to On.

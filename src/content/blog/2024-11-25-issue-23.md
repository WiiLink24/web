It’s been quite a while since we last spoke! We’ve done quite a bit of stuff in these past three months, so let’s dive right in and see what’s new!

### The Search for Nintendo Channel

That’s right, after ten long, painful, excruciating, heart-wrenching, somewhat arousing months Nintendo Channel is back! You can watch ten new videos right now, with more coming regularly! This breakthrough was possible thanks to our main developer, Sketch, working on the internal web panel, making it easier for the team to update the channel! New videos and banners with the latest Nintendo news and archives of old Nintendo Channel videos and shows!

### The Great Q&A of 2024

Like every year, we had another summer Q&A this year! We answered a lot of questions about Wii Room and WiiLink Originals, and played Vibribbon. It’s by far the longest Q&A we’ve done, and we think we made it worthwhile. The full recording is viewable on YouTube!

### Unleash the Music

The second show in the WiiLink Originals line, Sound Chamber was announced and released! Like Homebrew Tea, episodes are released monthly on Wii Room exclusively. Two episodes are available so far with twelve overall in the season, the current two episodes featuring kuatari and glitch gum. Go give them both a listen!

A bunch of new series were added to Wii Room in the past months! As well as new episodes of ryaltheamazing, Sudomemo Radio and RB77 (previously referred to as “realbubble” in our last update), chillysu and bigsleeter were added! We’ve spiced up the entries by including more non-Wii related videos, so take this opportunity to discover some new creators.

### Brighter Skies

We have had a Bluesky account for many months now, but we’ve reinstated our account and are now using it regularly! Updates made in the WiiLink Discord will now be announced at the same time on Bluesky, making it easier for users to stay updated and engage with the community without joining a Discord server! You can find us at @wiilink.ca, or the Japanese account at @jp.wiilink.ca (Yes, our site now uses the wiilink.ca domain and not wiilink24.com, if you didn’t notice). In addition, we occasionally use the YouTube community tab to keep people updated on events and WiiLink Originals info! If you don’t use any social media, you can still keep up to date using YouTube. [See you there](https://bsky.app/profile/wiilink24.com)!

  
  

Wow, is that really it, that felt like nothing at all! Thank you for continuing to use WiiLink throughout the years. Next month, we celebrate 4 years of WiiLink being available, and we’d love to see you then. But for now, see you next time!

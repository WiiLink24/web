Welcome back to the WiiLink website people! Try not to faint while reading this article, because when I found out, I almost died.

### WiiLink Discord Q&A

Today, in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/wiilink-750581992223146074), we had a Q&A session! In this, things such as Wii Room, Terebi no Tomo and Food Channel were discussed.

### Release Date

And finally, the part, you've been waiting for, the Food Channel release date is finally out! During the Q&A, it was announced that the official release date will be... *drumroll please*... **August 28th 2022**! To go alongside this, one of our very talented video editors [Pineapple](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfxa5lj2wsra8P0mi1BkJ5A) has created an awesome trailer to go alongside the release!

We all hope you enjoy the Food Channel as much as we enjoyed developing and translating it ~~(Sketch let me have my wife and kids back)~~, thank you for reading!

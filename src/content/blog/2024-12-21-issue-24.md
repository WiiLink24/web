## The WiiLink Month: 2024 Edition
There's something with WiiLink and December. We seem to get a lot of stuff done this month, and the same happened this year! Let's dive right in.

<br>

### The Legacy of Nintendo Channel
Nintendo Channel Legacy is being developed! Legacy is the name we're giving to the old version of Nintendo Channel with a different UI and banner! Sketch made a video detailing the first look into it, and the channel will be available to testers soon! Stay tuned for a release announcement.

### Introducing WiiLink (again)
We've finally made a general trailer for WiiLink and its services (courtesy of Kolton Ramos) to share with newcomers online. You can finally explain to your parents what you mean when you watch the news on the Wii.

### A nice refresher
The WiiLink Patcher was updated to v2.0.4! This update adds proper Dolphin support, EULA channels, various bug fixes and Linux optimizations! The patcher is downloadable from the main page.

### A rival network approaches
Pineapple News is now available on Wii Room, with new episodes coming out weekly. Join Pineapple as he desperately tries to beat out Homebrew Tea. At least, that's what I think it's about. We emailed him about the show and he booked a flight to Hawaii.

### WiiLink Originals in 60 seconds
As of November 26, we've started posting WiiLink Originals clips on YouTube Shorts and Bluesky! Don't worry, we're not posting exclusive content you have to check there for (knowing our audience, quite a few people inherently don't watch them), but we'll be using them to promote new episodes of shows when they come out, and we hope to build a good library of clips through these videos.

<br>

### The clock is ticking
We're holding a Wii Room giveaway, a chance to win a Japanese Wii with exclusive content right now! You only have until Christmas Day to apply, so act fast! Make sure your address is set properly on your Address Settings channel. (Shipping only applies to Japan, US, Canada and Europe.)

The Kirby TV Channel is back! Check in daily for more episodes of the Right Back at Ya anime!

Just to confirm, we've updated Nintendo Channel again! If you're curious if the channel is being updated, check the banner!

Harry Walker is now a part of our team, who has helped us extensively with community support, moderation and patcher development. He will probably be reading this, so be nice to him. Please.

### 4 years of WiiLink
A few weeks ago, we met our 4th anniversary of Wii Room, WiiLink's first release. It was a buggy mess that barely worked, but work continued to make it a genuinely nice app to open sometimes. 4 years later, WiiLink has grown beyond what any of us could have expected. 30000 members in our community, original content to watch on Wii Room, actual ordering on Food Channel, and welcoming a wealth of talent across the world. Your support has given us more than we could ever have asked for, and we are utterly greatful. Thank you for using WiiLink. Here's to the next year.

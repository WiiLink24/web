## Installation Guide

### What you need
___
- An SD Card or USB Drive
- A Wii with an Internet Connection
- A Windows, Mac, or Linux Computer
- [WiiLink Patcher](https://github.com/WiiLink24/WiiLink24-Patcher)

1. Download the latest version of the WiiLink Patcher for your operating system.

2. Launch the patcher and begin the download process by selecting "Express Install Setup"".
> Make sure your SD Card/USB Drive is connected to your Computer in order for the Patcher to automatically send your files to your Wii's SD Card/USB Drive.

3. After the Patcher is done downloading the files, simply disconnect your SD Card/USB Drive from your Computer, and input it into your Wii/Wii U.

4. Start up the Homebrew Channel and enter yawmME (YAWM ModMii Edition).

5. Highlight the WAD with `Wii Room (English)` as its name and press + to select it. When it is selected, press A twice to install the WAD.
> The WAD name might also be `Wii no Ma (Japan)` depending on what region of Console youre installing the Channel on. Please install the correct region version of the Channel on your Console.
#### If you happen to get `Error -1022` when installing `Wii Room (English)` or `Wii no Ma (Japan)`, uninstall the channel by selecting the WAD with `-` and pressing `A`. Then, re-install the WAD.

6. After it is successfully installed, press the HOME Button to exit back to the Homebrew Channel. Press the HOME Button again and select `"Exit to System Menu"`.

### Congrats! You've installed Wii Room on your Console! Enjoy the Channel to your hearts content!

## Troubleshooting & Questions

### "I keep running into an error code starting with `354`! What can I do?"

### "Videos keep buffering for me on playback!"

> This is most likely due to your Internet Connection, try bringing your console closer to your Router for a better signal.

### "Why can I not rent Movies or TV Shows in Wii Room?"

> You cannot view Movies & TV Shows from the Theater yet due to the feature not being implemented yet.

#### Section II - Registering your Console ID

1. After completing the setup process, go to the [**WiiLink Discord server**](https://discord.com/invite/reqUMqxu8D) to register your Wii's console ID.

2. Use the `Get Console ID` Homebrew App that was given by the patcher. This is used to retrieve your system's Console ID.

3. Visit the `#dominos-chat` channel on the Discord server.

4. Type the command `/dominos` in the chat, placing your **Console ID** that you got from the **Get Console ID** homebrew app, in the parameter box, otherwise the command will not work and will be posted publicly on the channel.

5. Double-check that you've typed the correct Console ID, as it can't be re-registered. If you need to re-register, ask a staff member in the server for assistance.

#### Section III - Installing WADs

## Troubleshooting & Questions

### "I got error -1017 when installing the Food Channel WAD! What do I do?"

> This is a known issue with the patcher! In the meantime, you will find a file titled Demae.wad on the root of your SD card. Use your favorite WAD manager to install!

### "I got error -1022 when installing the Food Channel WAD! What do I do?"

> Using your favorite WAD manager, uninstall the Food Channel, and install again. For many, this means going to the location the Food Channel WAD is located, and pressing the - (minus) button on your Wii remote, and pressing A to uninstall. Then, install the WAD again.

### "I'm getting an error message when adding food to my basket! What do I do?"

> Please try erasing save data for the Demae Channel, and setting it up again! Let us know in #demae-support if you continue to experience issues.

### "How do I pay for my order on the Food Channel?"

> The Food Channel only supports pay-on-delivery, where you will have to pay in either cash or card, to the delivery driver. You cannot input your card details into the Food Channel or Address Information menu.

### Does WiiLink save my address when using Food Channel?

> No, we cannot see your address. The only time we ever receive it is when you place an order, where it is sent straight to the provider (e.g. Dominos), not us.

## Installation Guide (Dominos)

#### Section I - Getting Started

##### What you need

* An SD Card or USB Drive
* A Wii console with an active Internet Connection
* A Computer with an active Internet Connection
* A Discord Account
* [WiiLink Patcher](https://github.com/WiiLink24/WiiLink24-Patcher)

1. Download the latest version of the WiiLink Patcher for your operating system.

2. Launch the patcher and begin the setup process.

3. When you see the setup screen, select `1. English Translation` in order to gain access to the Food Delivery Channel (Domino's) channel.<br><br>

4. Next, you’ll see this screen, asking which version of Food Delivery Channel you want, so you’ll want to pick `2. Domino's (US and Canada only)`<br><br>

5. After that, you can go through the rest of the process, but once you reach this step, be sure to pick the correct console platform you’re installing this on, as it will matter when using the app.<br><br>

#### Section II - Registering your Console ID

1. After completing the setup process, go to the [**WiiLink Discord server**](https://discord.com/invite/reqUMqxu8D) to register your Wii's console ID.

2. Use the `Get Console ID` Homebrew App that was given by the patcher. This is used to retrieve your system's Console ID.

3. Visit the `#dominos-chat` channel on the Discord server.

4. Type the command `/dominos` in the chat, placing your **Console ID** that you got from the **Get Console ID** homebrew app, in the parameter box, otherwise the command will not work and will be posted publicly on the channel.

5. Double-check that you've typed the correct Console ID, as it can't be re-registered. If you need to re-register, ask a staff member in the server for assistance.

#### Section III - Installing WADs

You will now install the Food Delivery Channel and Set Personal Data channels.

1. Put your SD card or USB drive in your Wii.

2. After registering your console ID, go to the Homebrew Channel and launch **YAWM ModMii Edition**.

3. In the WAD Manager menu, locate `Food Channel (Domino's) (English).wad`.

4. Also locate `WiiLink_SPD (Wii).wad` or `WiiLink_SPD (vWii).wad`, depending on your console platform.

5. Select both WADs by pressing `+` on each one.

6. Press `A` to install the selected WADs.

### If you happen to get `Error -1022` when installing `Food Channel (Domino's) (English).wad`, uninstall the channel by selecting the WAD with `-` and pressing `A`. Then, re-install the WAD.

#### Section IV - Setting your address information

> You are responsible for entering your correct address information. Failure to do so may result in orders not succeeding.

In this section you will be setting your address information. This is required for proper usage of Food Channel (Domino's). 

1. Launch the Food Channel from the Wii Menu.

Otherwise, click the `Change Address Information` button in the main menu.

## Troubleshooting & Questions

### "I got error -1017 when installing the Food Channel WAD! What do I do?"

> This is a known issue with the patcher! In the meantime, you will find a file titled Demae.wad on the root of your SD card. Use your favorite WAD manager to install!

### "I got error -1022 when installing the Food Channel WAD! What do I do?"

> Using your favorite WAD manager, uninstall the Food Channel, and install again. For many, this means going to the location the Food Channel WAD is located, and pressing the - (minus) button on your Wii remote, and pressing A to uninstall. Then, install the WAD again.

### "I'm getting an error message when adding food to my basket! What do I do?"

> Please try erasing save data for the Demae Channel, and setting it up again! Let us know in #demae-support if you continue to experience issues.

### "How do I pay for my order on the Food Channel?"

> The Food Channel only supports pay-on-delivery, where you will have to pay in either cash or card, to the delivery driver. You cannot input your card details into the Food Channel or Address Information menu.

### Does WiiLink save my address when using Food Channel?

> No, we cannot see your address. The only time we ever receive it is when you place an order, where it is sent straight to the provider (e.g. Dominos), not us.

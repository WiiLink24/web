1. Download the latest version of the WiiLink Patcher for your operating system.

<l class="notice info fullwidth">Make sure your SD Card/USB Drive is connected to your Computer in order for the Patcher to automatically send your files to your Wii's SD Card/USB Drive.</l>

3. After the Patcher is done downloading the files, simply disconnect your SD Card/USB Drive from your Computer, and input it into your Wii/Wii U.

4. Start up the Homebrew Channel and enter yawmME (YAWM ModMii Edition).

5. Highlight the WAD with `Photo Prints Channel (English)` or `Digicam Print Channel (Japan)` (depending on your Console Region) and `WiiLink SPD` as its name and press + to select them. When all of them are selected, press A twice to install the WADs.

<l class="notice info fullwidth">The `WiiLink SPD` file should have either `(Wii)` or `(vWii)` in its name depending on the Console you're installing it on.</l>

<l class="notice generic fullwidth">If you happen to get `Error -1022` when installing `Kirby TV Channel (WiiLink)`, uninstall the channel by selecting the WAD with `-` and pressing `A`. Then, re-install the WAD.</l>

## Troubleshooting & Questions

### "Are the photos directly mailed to me?"
> No. We use the email address you have registered via Set Personal Data.
> Your photos are rendered on our server, and a ZIP file is emailed directly to you.

> If you want your Photos printed, you will have to do that yourself with a Printer.

### "The Photo Prints Channel is telling me that my selected image is not supported!"

> Photo Print only supports "baseline" (not "progressive", or "interlaced") JPEGs. Here are some tips to make your photo compatible:
- Using Photoshop:

    - Go to File > Export > Save for Web (Legacy)

    - Change the format to JPEG. Make sure to uncheck 'Progressive' and 'Optimized'.

- Using Paint.NET:
    - Go to File -> Save As...

    - Change the 'Save as type' to JPEG, and save.

    - You do not need to change any options - Paint.NET does not support progressive JPEG, and will save as baseline.

### "Photo Print is telling me that my address is within 'Dallas, TX'"
> This is the default address. Please change it via the "Set Personal Data" App.

### "I use Dolphin. My photos or Miis sometimes become black. What can I do?"
> Within Dolphin's graphics settings, disable the setting "Store XFB Copies to Texture Only".

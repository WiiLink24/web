## Troubleshooting & Questions

### "Im getting Error Code '00006' on my console!"

> This problem is caused by vWii users not properly generating a timestamp for their consoles PriiLoader hacks. Simply refollow the `PriiLoader Setup` part of the guide, and try again once you're finished.

### "The Forecast Channel hangs on the loading screen for me!"

> This problem may simply either be because of a bad Internet Connection on your console. Please check your Wifi settings on your Wii/Wii U. If that doesnt work, then it may be a server error on our side of things, Weather Forecasts may not be available at this time.

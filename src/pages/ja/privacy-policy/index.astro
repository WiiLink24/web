            Privacy Policy
    </p>
    <p>
        The protection and confidentiality of personal data something WiiLink takes extremely seriously. We
        believe in protecting the information accessed in the most secure way possible. We also believe that
        being transparent on how we access your data leads to a bigger sense of trust with the consumer.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Please take your time and read through this Privacy Policy to the best of your ability to learn how
        we access and store your data. You will be notified through our Discord server if this document changes.

        service, you consent to our practices stated in this document. If you do not consent, please exit this
        page and do not use our services. Since this service utilizes the Domino's Pizza API, you are also

        If you do not live in the regions of the United States of America or Canada, you are not authorized to
        use this service. Please exit this website and do not return.

        What do we access?
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to use the Demae Domino's service, you must insert your correct personal information into
        the Set Personal Data channel on your Wii. This data is encrypted with AES-256-CBC, and is only ever
        on your Wii. Aside from this, there are other methods of data collection. Just by accessing this website,
        your IP address is being logged by our web server, nginx. When you purchase access to
        the Demae Domino's service, you enter payment information which is sent directly to Stripe, Inc.
        We access this data only in the following scenarios:
    </p>
    <br>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square">
        <li>Requesting nearby restaurants from Domino's Pizza</li>
        <li>Requesting the price of a basket from Domino's Pizza</li>
        <li>Placing an order to Domino's Pizza</li>
        <li>Purchasing access to the service on this website</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="subtitle">
        Personal Data that is accessed
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square">
        <li>Home Address</li>
        <li>Apartment Number (If applicable)</li>
        <li>Postal/Zip Code</li>
        <li>City</li>
        <li>Phone Number</li>
        <li>Email Address</li>
        <li>First Name</li>

        <li>IP Address</li>
        <li>Discord User ID</li>
        <li>Wii Console ID</li>
        <li>Payment Information</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
        WiiLink never stores any of this data except your IP Address, Discord User ID and Wii Console ID. Your IP Address is
        used to identify if you are from either the United States of America or Canada. It is also stored in
        our server logs. Your Discord User ID is used to link your Wii console to a user WiiLink can easily
        contact. Your Wii Console ID is stored to validate you purchased access to this channel. All other data is not stored by WiiLink, however it is sent to Domino's Pizza in
        your region. Please refer to the Privacy Policy in your region to see how they handle your data.

    </div>
    </section>
    <p>
        This website is secured by the latest version of the TLS protocol, TLSv1.3. Any transactions on this
        website is also secured by TLSv1.3 while being sent to Stripe, Inc. Your payment information is never
        stored by WiiLink.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        On the other-hand, the Wii only supports TLSv1.0, which is an outdated and insecure protocol. This is
        what the server on the Wii uses. As such the request is susceptible to MITM (Man-in-the-middle) attacks
        on your local network, which is when an attacker on your local network intercepts
        the request made by you to the server. However, this is much more secure than the alternative,
        no security.

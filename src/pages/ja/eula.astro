and you ("you", "your", or "users").

By using or accessing our WiiLink24 services
(the "Apps") or the website located at
https://wiilink24.com (the "Site"),
which are collectively referred to as the
"Service," you agree that you have read,
understood, and accept to be bound by the
Terms, and if you are between 13 (or the
minimum age of digital consent, as applicable)
and the age of majority in your jurisdiction,
that your legal guardian has reviewed and
agrees to these Terms.

The WiiLink24 Team reserves the right to
update these Terms, which we may do for
reasons that include, but are not limited to,
complying with changes to the law or
reflecting enhancements to the Service. If the
changes affect your usage of the Service or
your legal rights, we'll notify you no less
than seven days before the changes take
effect. Unless we state otherwise, your
continued use of the Service after we post
modifications will constitute your acceptance
of and agreement to those changes. If you
object to the changes, your recourse shall be
to cease using the Service.
